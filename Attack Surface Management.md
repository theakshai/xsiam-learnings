1. Potential entry points in an env attacker might target
2. Gives an external view for the organization

4. Not an ASM:
	1. Single point
	2. Not a fixed one 
	3. Not focus on a specific method
	4. Not a physical location
5. ASM Scanning:
	1. Cadence and Protocols = Based on proto scan varies, IP4 2/week, RDP more_times/day
	2. Known-asset monitoring
	3. Variouse Scans = Global, Known asset scan( immediate and frequent ), only added once customer validated the assets.
	4. Compilance and ethical scanning.
6. ASM Rules:
	1. set of policies to determine if the alert is generated on that surface.
	2. Enhance risk detect, early warning system, lib, severity classification, customization.
	3. enablement rule control, disabled rules ( except first 6 ), severity associations with rule ( critical, medium, low, high )
7. AST = Run the cve against the assets daily to see if it exists
8. Asset components: network and inventory ( physical )
9. specific assets: ip, domain, certs, external services
